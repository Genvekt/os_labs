To increase hit/miss ratio: 
	Sequense must have a lot of duplications and a lot of calls of page that was already referensed resently in nearest future
	(e.g. 100 100 100 100 200 200 100 300 200 is better than 100 300 145 140 200 500, 600)
To decrease hit/miss ratio:
	The page called resently must be called in as big amount of time us possible
	Plus sequense must have as small amount of repetitions as possible
	(e.g. 100 200 300 400 100 200 is worser than 100 100 200 200 300 400)

My sequenses:
To increase - sort sequense by page id
To decrease - place repetitions as far from each onter as possible
